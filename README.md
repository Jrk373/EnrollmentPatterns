# EnrollmentPatterns

Ok, so this is a research project about enrollment patterns in Northern Arizona.

We are going to look at things like zipcode, age, diagnosis group, etc. in an effort to see if there are any patterns that could be used to prevent negative effects to VBP scores.

For example, are there Zipcodes that experience a more rapid turnover of enrollments that may result in a person dropping off of rosters before they can be followed up with after hospitalization.
